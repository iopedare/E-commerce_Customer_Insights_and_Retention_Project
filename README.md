# E-commerce Customer Insights and Retention Project

## **Objective**

The marketing team of an e-commerce store are planning a campaign aimed at gaining insights into customer behavior to enhance customer acquisition and retention strategies. The primary objective of this project is to leverage Python programming to analyze e-commerce customer data by utilizing Python's powerful data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The aim is to understand customer behavior, continuously monitor and analyze campaign performance, and making data-driven adjustment as necessary. 

## **Project Steps**

### 1. **Data Sourcing and Collection**
   - Gather e-commerce transactional data containing key information such as:
     - `InvoiceNo`: Unique transaction identifier.
     - `StockCode`: Product code.
     - `Description`: Product name.
     - `Quantity`: Number of items sold.
     - `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of transaction.
     - `UnitPrice`: Price per unit of product.
     - `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier.
     - `Country`: Country where the transaction occurred.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   - Ensure consistency and accuracy to establish a reliable dataset for analysis.

### 3. **Data Type Adjustment**
   - Adjust data columns to appropriate types:

### 4. **Analysis and Insights Generation**
   - Analyze cleaned data to identify patterns in customer behavior, focusing on acquisition, retention, and loyalty.
   - Perform RFM analysis to segment customers based on their purchase recency, frequency, and monetary value.
   - Identify high-value customers, loyal shoppers, and those at risk of churn to tailor targeted marketing strategies.
   - Create detailed profiles of customers by analyzing demographic and behavioral data.
   - Segment customers into distinct groups (e.g., low-, mid-, and high-value) for personalized marketing efforts.

### 5. **Data Visualization**
   - Use data visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore and communicate key insights:
     - Visualize sales trends over time.
     - Create scatter plot to show purchasing behavior across different customer segments.
     - Plot distributions of recency, frequency, and monetary value to highlight customer spending patterns.


## **Conclusion**

This project aims to utilize data-driven strategies to boost customer acquisition and retention for the e-commerce business. By understanding customer behavior and leveraging targeted incentives, the project will help to enhance customer loyalty and drive business growth.
